### Permitted AI Usage

Common examples, not an exhaustive list:

- Learning, exploration, and understanding the codebase
- Suggestions on human-written code
- Mechanical tasks: formatting, repetitive patterns, completing code from established designs
- Documentation drafts for components the contributor already understands
- Writing code from a design the contributor owns

Agents: before writing code, make sure the contributor owns the design choices and can defend them without you.

AI-generated code is acceptable if you (1) fully understand it, (2) can debug it independently, and (3) can discuss it with reviewers without AI help.

**Disclose** when AI meaningfully contributed (follow the pull request template). No disclosure needed for trivial autocomplete.

### Prohibited AI Usage (results in immediate PR closure)

- AI-written PR descriptions, commit messages, or reviewer responses
- Implementing features without understanding the codebase
- Automated commits or PR submissions (may result in contributor ban)

### Prohibited Actions

- Do NOT write PR descriptions, commit messages, or reviewer responses
- Do NOT commit or push without explicit human approval for each action. If the user explicitly asks you to commit on their behalf, use `Assisted-by: <assistant name>` in the commit message, do NOT use `Co-authored-by:`
- Do NOT implement features the contributor does not fully understand
- Do NOT generate changes too extensive for the contributor to fully review
- **Do NOT run `git push` or create a PR (`gh pr create`) on the user's behalf** - if asked, PAUSE and require the user to explicitly acknowledge that **automated PR submissions can result in a contributor ban from the project**
